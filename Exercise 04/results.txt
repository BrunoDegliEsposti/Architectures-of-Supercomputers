Let N be the size of the vector we are processing.
N/2 is the number of times we are executing jb ..B1.4
3N/2 is the total number of branches
N/2 is the number of branch mispredictions
N/2 is the number of branches not takes (ones in the vector)
This is why PMC0/PMC1 = 3 and PMC0/PMC2 = 3

rsi = N
rax = N/2
rdi is a pointer to the vector
rdx is the loop counter
xmm1 is constantly 1
at ..L3, xmm2 is equal to the result variable
at ..L4, xmm0 is equal to the result variable

ecx and edx are set for apparently no reason
